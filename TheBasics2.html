                <h3>GET Method</h3>
                <p>
                  To communicate with the Petfinder API we must use the GET method. GET requests send the information needed by the target, usually a server, in the URL
                  by appending it to the end. Whether you know it or not, you have seen this many times. If you didn’t know what to look for it is very likely it just looked like random garbled code.
                  Now it is important that you understand what this seemingly garbled code stands for because this is how you interact with the API.
                   </p>
                   <h4>The URL</h4>
                   <p>
                     URL stands for Uniform Resource Locater and it is the address of the resource you are requesting.
                     The URL can be broken down into parts, each part getting more and more specific until it maps to exactly
                     what you want. Similarly, if someone wants to send you a package, they need to know all the details that will
                     route the package to your house. They need your home address, which is comprised of your country, state, city,
                     street, house number, and possibly apartment number. If they are missing any part, aside from the country,
                     it is very likely you won't get your package. The same goes for the URL. If you are missing any part of it, aside from the
                     HTTP, you probably aren’t going to get where you are trying to go.

                </p>
                <h5>Let's take a look at the sample code from the Petfinder API documentation:</h5>
                <p>
                <code>http://api.petfinder.com/my.method?key=12345&arg1=foo&token=67890&sig=abcdef</code>
                </p>
                <div class="dropdown">
                  <ul class="rest">
                    <li>
                      <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#http">HTTP  <span class="caret"></span></button>
                        <div id="http" class="collapse">
                        <p class="list">
                          <code>http:</code> (HyperText Transfer Protocol) This is the request-response protocol between the client and server.
          	            </p>
          	            <p class="list">
                          When the internet was new, this always needed to be in front of the URL or else it wouldn't work. Now, it would be a safe bet that you
                          never write it in front of a URL you are typing from memory, yet it still works. This is because it can be assumed that every URL is
                          using HTTP, the same as a letter sent within the United States without writing USA will still get there. If you
                          look at the rest of the address format, there are hints, such as the state it is going to, that imply its destination is in this country.
                          URLs all follow a precise format which implies it is following correct protocol.

          	             </p>
                         <p class="list">

                          <code>my.method</code> Directions to the destination. The path starts with a single slash (never double), and any subsequent segments are separated slashes. The segments
                          are usually in a specific hierarchical order like the file path on your OS. While the path may be empty (no extra information after the domain), it is always defined.
                          Finding your way to the main page with nothing more than the domain name is considered following a path.

                          <code>?key=12345&arg1=foo&token=67890&sig=abcdef</code> represents the information being transferred to the server in a GET
                          request. Most parameters are formatted as <code>name=info</code> with & between each set of values.
                        </p>
                      </div>

                <p>
                  Here is code for a basic GET form. You can't send a GET request from fiddle, but this at least gives you code to play with.
                <script clas="fiddle" async src="//jsfiddle.net/spiffiKay/thy8wunc/embed/html,result/"></script>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is the simple form this code creates with the fields filled out and ready to send:
                  <img src="GETForm.png" />
                  And this is the query line added to the end of the URL when this GET form is sent (remember, this is appended to the URL given in the code above):
                  <img id="query" src="queryline.png" />
                </p>
                <h5>Let's break this query down:</h5>
                <p>
                  The white question mark signifies the beginning of the query. The label and input for the first field on the form are in pink.
                  <code>text_input</code> is the label and <code>Send+me%21</code> (%21 is the !) is the input, and their relation to each other is signified with  <code>=</code>.
                  The green ampersand <code>&</code>links the two fields from the form together. There is generally an ampersand between each set of data sent.
                   The information for the second field <code>numerical_input=4321</code> is in blue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hopefully this gives you a better understanding of what all the seemingly random code at the end of the URL means.

              <div class="wells" id="white">
                <h3>JSON</h3>
                <p>
                  <a id="tooBright" href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a data syntax. When requesting data from
                  the API, all the data must be sent in text form. Communications with this API can be in XML or JSON format. XML is a little dated and JSON is
                  more widely used now, so we will be sticking with JSON. Javascript objects can easily be changed into JSON, and vice versa, making
                  sending and using data simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                  JavaScript and JSON objects are very similar, and it is easy to change from one type of object to another. A JSON object is basically a JavaScript object converted into a string.
                  <code>JSON.stringify()</code> will turn a JS object into a JSON string object and <code>JSON.parse()</code> turns the JSON string into a JavaScrpt object.
                </p>
                <img id="objects" src="JSONtoJS.png" />
                <p>
                  Here is an example of a JSON object parsed into the JavaScript object which is then used with the HTML. Feel free to tinker with it a bit.

                <h3>jQuery</h3>
                <p>
                  jQuery is a JavaScript library, and it exists to make your life easier. It is used extensively all over the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  jQuery is most likely used on the site of any company you can think of. It is extremely popular and all major browsers support it. If you already have a rudimentary understanding
                  of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is easy to learn and it cuts down on the amount of code you need to write. <a href=” https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp”>Here</a> is a
                  great tutorial to get you started. There is a bunch of functionality jQuery can add to your site, but in this guide we are focusing mainly on the jQuery GET method.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To use jQuery you can download and host the library yourself, or you can include a <a href=” http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html”> CDN</a>  (Content Delivery Network) in your
                  code from a site that hosts it. In this site and for the API we use the<a href=” https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/”> Google CDN</a>. It should be placed in the header
                  of the HTML file as demonstrated below.
                </p>
                <img src="jQueryCDN.png" />
                <h4> jQuery $.get() Method and AJAX</h4>
                <p>
                  As you know, the GET method requests data from the server via a GET request. The jQuery $.get() method is no different, it just has different syntax than you may be used to. The
                  example above didn’t use JavaScript because there was no need to complicate the concept with syntax we won’t be working with.
                </p>
                <p>
                  $.get() is an AJAX method. To put it simply, <a href=”https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started”>AJAX</a> is a way to communicate back and forth with the server,
                  potentially updating parts of the page the user is interacting with without needing to update the entire page. We could go into a lot more detail about AJAX and its functionality,
                  but for our purposes that is about all we need to know.
