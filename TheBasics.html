                <h3>API</h3>
                <h4>What is an API?</h4>
                  <p id="apiInfo">
                    <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/news/apis-are-user-interfaces-just-different-users-mind/analysis/2015/12/03">API</a> stands for Application Program Interface.
                    What they provide can vary greatly from host to host. Generally, APIs provide access to information or functionality that the host has developed
                    or owns, while abstracting the underlying implementation. Each API has clearly defined protocols and tools to shape how you interact with and access
                    their data. Developers can build an application around one or more APIs making the development process much easier and more efficient.
                  </p>
                <h4>Web APIs</h4>
                  <p>
                    Developers usually interact with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI">web APIs</a> via sending HTTP requests, then receiving a response of data in
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp">XML</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp">JSON</a> format. The developer
                    then uses this data in their own applications, often resulting in the data reaching new and different users than would have otherwise been reached.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Petfinder API gives access to their expansive database, as well as many options for gathering and using the information. We will get into the specifics of this in a little bit.
                  </p>
                  <h4>RESTful APIs</h4>
                  <p>
                    The Petfinder API is a <a href="http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com/definition/RESTful-API">RESTful API</a>.
                    The structure of a RESTful API is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>
                    architecture style. In order for an API to be RESTful it must abide by these six required constraints:
                  </p>
                <div class="dropdown">
                  <ul class="rest">
                    <li><button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#client">Client-Server  <span class="caret"></span></button>
                      <div id="client" class="collapse">
                      <p class="list">
                        The client interface and server interface and storage are completely separate allowing both to be altered and scaled
                        independently of each other. This means both you and the host are free to change different aspects on your respective ends without worrying
                        about “breaking” the other end.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    </li>
                    <li><button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#state">Stateless  <span class="caret"></span></button>
                      <div id="state" class="collapse">
                      <p class="list">
                        No client context is stored on the server between requests during client-server communication. The state of the session, as well as all
                        the necessary information, is in the client request. If the session must be in a persistent state, such as for authentication, the
                        session state can be transferred to a different, intermediary server.
                      </p>
                      <p class="list">
                        To transition to a new state, the client sends requests to the server. If there are one or more outstanding requests, the client is considered “in
                        transition.” While a process may be comprised of many requests and states, each individual request can stand alone and is a potential
                        end or beginning state to a process.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li><button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#cache">Cacheable  <span class="caret"></span></button>
                    <div id="cache" class="collapse">
                      <p class="list">
                        Both clients and intermediary servers can cache responses. Clients must define their responses as either cacheable or not. If a response
                        has time sensitive data and is cached, the information may become stale. Being able to flag whether the response is cacheable or not
                        can eliminate excess client-server interactions improving overall performance.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li><button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#layered">Layered System  <span class="caret"></span></button>
                    <div id="layered" class="collapse">
                      <p class="list">
                        When a client is communicating with the API, they have no way of knowing if they are interacting with the main server or an intermediary server.
                        This enables load balancing, which is more efficient, and helps in terms of security.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li><button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#code">Code on Demand  <span class="caret"></span></button>
                    <div id="code" class="collapse">
                      <p class="list">
                        This is the only constraint that could be considered optional. While it may never be utilized, a server can transfer executable code to
                        the client, temporarily changing the client’s functionality.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li><button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#uniform">Uniform Interface  <span class="caret"></span></button>
                    <div id="uniform" class="collapse">
                      <p class="list">
                        The REST system design is reliant on the idea of individual functionality of each part of the whole. This can only be achieved if every aspect of
                        the interface is uniform. Because each part is capable of being autonomous, they can change without
                        affecting the other parts. We could go into great detail as to how this is implemented, but this is a little outside the scope of this guide.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>
                The most common way to use RESTful APIs is to use HTTP protocol using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. The Petfinder API currently only
                uses the GET method, so that is where our focus will lie.
