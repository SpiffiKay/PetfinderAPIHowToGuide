                <h4>What is an API?</h4>
                  <p id="apiInfo">
                    API stands for Application Program Interface. What they provide can vary greatly
                    from host to host. Generally, APIs provide access to information or functionality
                    that the host has developed or owns Each API has clearly defined protocols and tools
                    to shape how you interact with and access their data. Basically, they provide an easy
                    way to use pre-defined information and functionality, saving you, the developer, a lot of time.

                    The Petfinder API gives you access to their expansive database, as well as many options for
                    gathering and using the information, but we will get into specifics in a little bit.

                  <h4>RESTful API</h4>
                  <p>
                    The Petfinder API is a <a href="http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com/definition/RESTful-API">RESTful API</a>.
                    The structure of a RESTful API is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>
                    architecture style. In order for an API to be RESTful it must abide by these six required constraints:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="rest">
                    <li>
                      Client-Server:
                      <p class="list">
                        User interface concerns from storage concerns are completely separate--the user interface and the server can be altered and scaled
                        independently of each other. This means if the database you are accessing changes your interface is not affected, and vice versa.
                        This frees both you and the host to change different aspects on your end as you see fit without worrying about “breaking” other parts.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Stateless:
                      <p class="list">
                        No client context is stored on the server between requests during client-server communication. The state of the session, as well as all
                        the necessary information, is in the client request. If the session must be in a persistent state, such as for authentication, the
                        session state can be transferred to a different server.
                      </p>
                      <p class="list">
                        To transition to a new state, the client sends requests to the server. If there are one or more outstanding requests, the client is “in
                        transition.” While a process may be comprised of many requests and states, each individual request can stand alone and is a potential
                        end or beginning state to a process.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Cacheable:
                      <p class="list">
                        Both clients and intermediary servers can cache responses. Clients must define their responses as either cacheable or not. If a response
                        has time sensitive data, if it were cached, the information may become stale. Being able to flag whether the response is cacheable or not
                        can eliminate excess client-server interactions improving overall performance.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Layered System:
                      <p class="list">
                        A client can be communicating with the main server, or an intermediary server, and the client generally cannot tell which it is in contact
                        with. This enables load balancing and helps in terms of security.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Code on Demand:
                      <p class="list">
                        This is the only constraint that could be considered optional. While it may never be utilized, a server can transfer executable code to
                        the client, temporarily changing the client’s functionality.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Uniform Interface
                      <p class="list">
                        The REST system design is anchored around the idea of each part having the ability to function independently from the whole. This is the
                        base of the RESTful concept, and can only be achieved if the interface is uniform. Because each part does not rely on the other parts,
                        they can change without effecting all the other parts. We could go into great detail as to how this is implemented, but this is a little
                        outside the scope of this guide.
                      </p>
